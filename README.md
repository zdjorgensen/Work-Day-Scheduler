For the fifth challenge, `Work Day Scheduler` I took the provided code and turned it into a functional scheduler using `JavaScript` and `JQuery` mostly. Getting the current date set up was simple and I had the idea to use military time to track what hour it was instead of keeping track of if the time was in the AM or PM which I think sounded hard. Working with font awesome was cool but it was also confusing getting it to work. The hardest part was pulling the information down from `local storage` and putting that information into the correct time block `textarea` but eventually I got everything to work and I think it looks good. I used the previous activites, Zoom classes and Google to help for this challenge.

To use this scheduler, after the user types in the `textarea`, they can hit the blue save button which saves the text into `local storage`. After the user refreshes the page, that information is pulled into the correct time block and is displayed. The time blocks do change color depending on what time it is. `Grey` is for the past, `red` is for the present, and `green` is for the future.
